# HotLinks

This is a fun little app I'm making to play around with Swift.

I have a lot of Zoom links for my online classes and robotics team.

I'm currently storing them in a note document but after 2 days it got really irritating to use.

I'm trying to see if it's possible for me to store them in an app form for myself.

If I get this working, I may make it usable for other too with a SQLite Database to store the link items.
